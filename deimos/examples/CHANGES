A few changes have been made in order to facilitate using this library from D.
(line number):(filename)
A list of the changes and the reasons for the change is below:
124:elm_general.d
    MACRO ELM_MAIN() is now a string mixin.
    You can pass if the string of any function you wish to call.
    e.g     mixin(ELM_MAIN!()); //default sub is: return elm_main(int argc, char** argv) 
            mixin(ELM_MAIN!("custom_thing(); return elm_main(argc, argv); "));
    REAON:  It seemed like a very useful thing to have, plus I try to keep things the same.
