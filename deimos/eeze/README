What is Eeze?

Eeze is a library for manipulating devices through udev with a simple and fast
api. It interfaces directly with libudev, avoiding such middleman daemons as
udisks/upower or hal, to immediately gather device information the instant it
becomes known to the system.  This can be used to determine such things as:
        * If a cdrom has a disk inserted
        * The temperature of a cpu core
        * The remaining power left in a battery
        * The current power consumption of various parts
        * Monitor in realtime the status of peripheral devices

Each of the above examples can be performed by using only a single eeze
function, as one of the primary focuses of the library is to reduce the
complexity of managing devices.

UDEV functions
        * watch Functions that watch for events
        * syspath Functions that accept a device /sys/ path
        * find Functions which find types of devices

These are the device subsystems of udev:
        * ac97
        * acpi
        * bdi
        * block
        * bsg
        * dmi
        * graphics
        * hid
        * hwmon
        * i2c
        * input
        * mem
        * misc
        * net
        * pci
        * pci_bus
        * pci_express
        * platform
        * pnp
        * rtc
        * scsi
        * scsi_device
        * scsi_disk
        * scsi_generic
        * scsi_host
        * serio
        * sound

        * block
        * cd
        * char
        * disk
